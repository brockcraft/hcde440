//HEAVY commenting is on . . .
//In this program we are publishing and subscribing to a MQTT server that requires a login/password
//authentication scheme. We are connecting with a unique client ID, which is required by the server.
//This unique client ID is derived from our device's MAC address, which is unique to the device, and
//thus unique to the universe.
//
//We are publishing with a generic topic ("theTopic") which you should change to ensure you are publishing
//to a known topic (eg, if everyone uses "theTopic" then everyone would be publishing over everyone else, which
//would be a mess). So, create your own topic channel.
//
//We have hardcoded the topic and the subtopics in the mqtt.publish() function, because those topics and sub
//topics are never going to change. We have subscribed to the super topic using the directory-like addressing
//system MQTT provides. We subscribe to 'theTopic/+' which means we are subscribing to 'theTopic' and every
//sub-topic that might come after the main topic. We denote this with a '+' symbol.
//
//Please change your super topic and don't use 'theTopic'.
